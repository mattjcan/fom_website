      <description>When the Hazelwood power station shut last year the Australian Conservation Foundation claimed that its closure was a signal that “the era of polluting coal is coming to an end.”1
In its last full year of operation, the Hazelwood power station generated 10 terawatt hours of coal power.2 In the last year, coal fired power generation has increased in the Asia Pacific region by 330 terawatt hours. So, in effect, in just one year, the Asian region has brought online the equivalent of 33 Hazelwoods - while we shut one coal fired power station in Australia.</description>
