      <description>I want to thank the National Press Club for this opportunity and thank them for co-hosting this event with the National Rural Press Club. Thanks to their President Colin Bettles and his committee for helping to make this happen. We need more voices from the regions heard in Canberra.
I am here to talk about rocks and hydrocarbons but I am going to start talking about people.
First, Alicia. I met Alicia on a visit to the Peak Downs coal mine in Central Queensland.</description>
